  "summary": "The note comprehensively covers all required suitability elements under COBS 9.2. Client objectives are clearly documented with specific income targets for retirement. Attitude to risk is evidenced by a named questionnaire (Dynamic Planner) with a numeric score, and capacity for loss is assessed distinctly with reference to the client's overall financial position and the proportion of liquid wealth at risk. The financial situation section provides detailed income, expenditure, asset, and liability figures. Knowledge and experience is assessed with appropriate depth. The recommendation rationale is client-specific and uses explicit causal language linking the client's profile to each element of the recommendation. Charges are disclosed in both percentage and monetary terms with a cross-reference to the separately issued CCI. Alternatives were considered with a reasoned explanation for the preferred product. Client confirmation of understanding and agreement was recorded. No material gaps identified.",
