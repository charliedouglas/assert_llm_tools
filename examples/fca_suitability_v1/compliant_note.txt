ADVISER MEETING NOTE — SUITABILITY RECORD
Client: Margaret Thornton
Date of meeting: 14 February 2026
Adviser: R. Bassett, DipPFS
Meeting format: In person at client's home, 10:00–11:45
Next review due: February 2027

PURPOSE OF MEETING

This meeting was held to carry out the client's annual portfolio review, discuss
pension decumulation planning ahead of her intended retirement date of June 2027,
and consider a new ISA subscription for the current tax year.

---

CLIENT OBJECTIVES

Margaret confirmed that her primary objective is to build sufficient pension income
to retire comfortably at age 67 (June 2027 — 16 months from this meeting). She is
targeting a net retirement income of approximately £28,000 per annum, comprising:
her State Pension (projected £11,502 pa full new State Pension, confirmed via HMRC
forecast letter seen today), a Teachers' Pension Scheme benefit of approximately
£9,000 pa (confirmed from TP statement dated January 2026), and supplementary
drawdown income of approximately £7,500–£8,000 pa from her personal pension.

Secondary objective: capital preservation in real terms to support a potential care
funding requirement in later life. Margaret is not seeking capital growth above
inflation over the next 16 months; she wishes to de-risk progressively into
retirement. She confirmed no liquidity requirements during the accumulation phase —
she maintains a separate cash emergency fund of £12,000 (three months' expenditure).
She would like to maximise her ISA allowance this year (£20,000) for tax-efficient
capital in retirement.

ATTITUDE TO RISK AND CAPACITY FOR LOSS

Margaret's attitude to risk was re-assessed today using the Dynamic Planner
questionnaire (completed in the meeting). Score: 43/100 — Cautious/Balanced
boundary, consistent with her score of 41/100 at the February 2025 review.
Assigned risk category: Cautious (DP 4/10).

Capacity for loss: assessed as Low-Medium. Margaret's financial position (see
below) shows that her investment capital (£124,000 SIPP + £34,000 S&S ISA)
represents approximately 78% of her liquid net worth. She is a single homeowner
with modest monthly outgoings. While she has stable employment income until
retirement and Teachers' Pension as a guaranteed income floor, a sustained
portfolio loss of more than 15–20% would be a source of material financial stress
and could affect her retirement income plan. I have positioned her capacity for
loss at Low-Medium and treated this as the binding constraint, consistent with
her Cautious ATR. No conflict between ATR and CfL requiring resolution.

---

FINANCIAL SITUATION

Income: annual salary £41,200 (full-time teacher, Northwood Academy). Net monthly
income approximately £2,720. Monthly committed expenditure: mortgage £610 (repayment,
12 years remaining, outstanding balance £87,400, property estimated value £310,000),
household and living costs approximately £1,200. Estimated monthly surplus: £910,
of which £400 is currently paid into the personal pension by direct debit. No
consumer debt. No dependants.

Existing arrangements:
  - Personal pension (SIPP, Transact): £124,000 (valued 10/02/2026). Fund: Vanguard
    LifeStrategy 60% Equity. Contribution: £400 pm (basic rate relief applied at
    source). Annual allowance utilisation: £4,800 pa — well within £60,000 limit.
  - Teachers' Pension Scheme (DB): in payment from age 60 (estimated £9,000 pa,
    confirmed from January 2026 TP statement).
  - Stocks & Shares ISA (Transact): £34,000 (valued 10/02/2026). Fund: same as SIPP.
  - Cash savings: £12,000 (current and easy access accounts).
  - Property: primary residence (estimated £310,000, mortgage £87,400 outstanding).

No other investments, pensions, or material financial assets disclosed. Margaret
confirmed no changes to her financial situation since the February 2025 review other
than a 2% salary increase and approximately £9,000 growth across the SIPP and ISA.

KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERIENCE

Margaret has held the SIPP and ISA for seven years and is familiar with collective
investment schemes including unit trusts and OEICs. She understands that investment
returns fluctuate and that capital is not guaranteed. She has a basic understanding
of risk and return trade-offs appropriate for a Cautious investor. She is not
familiar with complex instruments (derivatives, structured products) and has no
professional financial background. She confirmed she understands the recommendation
being made today, and I offered to provide a simplified explanation of the proposed
fund change; she declined, stating she was comfortable with the information provided.

RECOMMENDATION AND SUITABILITY RATIONALE

I recommend the following:

1. ISA subscription: £20,000 (full 2025/26 annual allowance) into the Transact
   Stocks & Shares ISA, invested in the Royal London Sustainable Managed Income
   Fund (OEIC, SFDR Article 8, OCF 0.37% pa). Reason for fund selection: the
   fund's Cautious/Balanced risk profile (DP 4/10) aligns with Margaret's confirmed
   ATR and CfL. The income-generating characteristic (target yield approximately
   3.5% pa) supports her transition to an income-focused portfolio in retirement.
   The managed allocation (approximately 50% bonds, 35% equity, 15% alternatives)
   provides lower volatility consistent with her low-medium CfL and reduces
   concentration risk relative to the existing LifeStrategy 60% holding.

2. SIPP de-risking: switch 50% of the existing SIPP holding (approximately £62,000)
   from Vanguard LifeStrategy 60% Equity to the same Royal London fund, phased over
   three monthly switches to avoid timing risk. Reason: with retirement 16 months
   away, sequencing risk management is appropriate. The resulting blended SIPP
   allocation post-switch (approximately 30% equity / 55% bonds / 15% alternatives)
   is well-suited to the transition to drawdown. No guaranteed annuity rates or
   other benefits are lost by the switch (confirmed — SIPP is a standard contract).
   No exit charges apply on the existing fund.

3. Pension contribution: continue existing £400 pm SIPP contribution for the
   remaining employment period (16 months, total approximately £6,400 gross
   including tax relief). Reason: annual allowance headroom is sufficient (£4,800
   utilised vs. £60,000 limit); contributions continue to benefit from basic rate
   tax relief (20%); stopping contributions would reduce the terminal fund
   unnecessarily given the modest impact on monthly cashflow.

This recommendation is suitable because it addresses Margaret's specific objective
of building a de-risked pension pot to support £7,500–£8,000 pa drawdown income
in retirement, is consistent with her Cautious risk profile and Low-Medium CfL,
uses instruments well within her knowledge and experience, and is appropriate for
her 16-month time horizon.

understood the charges and considered them reasonable given the service provided.

ALTERNATIVES CONSIDERED

I considered retaining the Vanguard LifeStrategy 60% Equity throughout, but
concluded this would leave Margaret's portfolio with excessive equity exposure
(60%) given the 16-month time horizon and her Cautious ATR. I also considered the
Vanguard LifeStrategy 40% Equity as an alternative de-risking vehicle (OCF 0.22%,
lower than Royal London at 0.37%); however, it does not offer the income-generating
characteristics relevant to Margaret's transition to drawdown, and lacks the managed
alternatives allocation that provides diversification at this stage of the investment
journey. The additional 0.15% pa cost of the Royal London fund is justified by these
differentiating features.

CLIENT CONFIRMATION

I presented and explained the recommendation verbally during the meeting. Margaret
confirmed she understood the rationale, agreed with the recommended de-risking
approach, and had no further questions. The Suitability Report and updated Costs
and Charges Illustration will be issued within 5 business days (by 20/02/2026).
Margaret was advised to await the report before giving implementation instructions.
She confirmed she is comfortable with this process. A signed letter of authority
will be requested with the Suitability Report.
