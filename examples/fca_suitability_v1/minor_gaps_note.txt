ADVISER MEETING NOTE
Client: James Whitfield
Date: 14 February 2026
Adviser: P. Okonkwo
Format: Video call (Teams), 09:30–10:20

PURPOSE

Initial advice meeting. James contacted the firm via the website following a
recommendation from a colleague. He has approximately £45,000 he wishes to invest
in a Stocks & Shares ISA and potentially a GIA, following receipt of a bonus.

---

OBJECTIVES

James is 42, works as a solicitor (partner level), and is primarily focused on
wealth accumulation over the medium to long term. He does not have an immediate
income requirement from this investment and expects to hold it for at least
10–15 years. He mentioned he is also contributing to a workplace pension (does
not know the exact value — to be confirmed separately). He has no immediate plans
to draw on this investment and is not planning any major expenditure in the next
5 years. He would like to maximise the ISA allowance first (£20,000), with the
remainder (approximately £25,000) in a GIA.

---

RISK PROFILE

James completed the firm's risk questionnaire via the client portal ahead of this
meeting. Score: 67/100 — assessed as Moderately Adventurous (category 6/7 on the
firm's scale). I discussed the result with James during the call; he confirmed it
felt appropriate.

Capacity for loss: James mentioned he is comfortable with the possibility of
short-term losses, as this investment represents money he does not need. I noted
this and assessed his CfL as medium-high. He did not provide specific figures on
his overall wealth position (he indicated he had other investments and property),
so my CfL assessment is based on his self-attestation that this sum is discretionary
capital he could afford to lose without affecting his lifestyle. I would prefer to
gather more detailed financial information at a follow-up meeting to strengthen
this assessment.

FINANCIAL SITUATION

James is a partner at a City law firm. Annual income in the region of £180,000–
£220,000 (variable, including drawings and bonus). He confirmed his outgoings are
comfortably met by his income and he carries no consumer debt. He owns a property
in London with a mortgage (details not obtained). He has a workplace pension but
was unable to confirm the value during this call. Total liquid assets beyond this
investment were not fully quantified in this meeting. I will request a full financial
fact-find form be completed before issuing the suitability report.

RECOMMENDATION

I recommend James invests £20,000 in a Stocks & Shares ISA and £25,000 in a GIA,
both on the Transact platform, invested in the following funds:

  - 60% global equity (Vanguard FTSE All-World UCITS ETF, OCF 0.22%)
  - 25% developed market bonds (iShares Core Global Aggregate Bond ETF, OCF 0.10%)
  - 15% UK commercial property (CBRE UK Property PAIF, OCF 0.80%)

This allocation is consistent with a Moderately Adventurous risk profile and aligns
with a 10–15 year accumulation time horizon. The global equity allocation provides
diversified growth exposure. The bond element provides some downside cushion. The
property component adds a real asset diversifier. All funds are UCITS or UK-authorised
collective investment schemes appropriate for a retail investor.

The ISA wrapper is recommended first to maximise the annual tax-free allowance.
The GIA is appropriate for the excess given James's higher-rate tax position and
ability to manage CGT via annual exemption.

CHARGES

Platform fee (Transact): 0.25% pa.
Blended fund OCF: approximately 0.28% pa.
Adviser initial charge: 1.5% (£675 on £45,000).
Adviser ongoing charge: 0.60% pa.
Total ongoing cost: approximately 1.13% pa.

A full Costs and Charges Illustration will be issued with the suitability report.

CLIENT CONFIRMATION

James indicated he was happy with the proposed approach and keen to proceed. I
advised him that I would issue a Suitability Report within the next 10 days and
that he should not action anything until he has received and reviewed it. He agreed.
