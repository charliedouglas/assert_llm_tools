  "summary": "This note fails to meet the minimum requirements of a suitability record under COBS 9.2 across almost every required element. Client objectives are not documented beyond a vague statement that the client wants to invest rather than leave money in the bank. There is no record of any risk profiling — no questionnaire, no ATR score, no risk category assigned. Capacity for loss is entirely absent. The financial situation section contains no income, expenditure, asset, or liability information. Knowledge and experience has not been assessed. The recommendation rationale consists of generic fund descriptions (track record, investment style) that would be equally applicable to any client, with no connection to this client's specific circumstances, goals, or risk tolerance. Charges are mentioned only in percentage terms without monetary illustration and without disclosure of all applicable cost categories. Alternatives were not considered. Client confirmation is limited to a positive reaction with no evidence the recommendation was formally explained or accepted. As the note stands, it does not constitute a suitability record — it is closer to a transaction record. A full suitability assessment must be conducted and documented before any implementation instructions are acted upon.",
