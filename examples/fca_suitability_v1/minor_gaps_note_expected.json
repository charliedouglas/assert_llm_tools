  "summary": "The note covers the key structural elements of a suitability record but has notable gaps that prevent a pass under the default policy. Client objectives and the time horizon are documented, and a risk questionnaire score is cited. However, the capacity for loss assessment relies on the client's self-attestation without independent verification of their overall wealth position — the adviser explicitly acknowledged this limitation. Knowledge and experience is not assessed: there is no record of the client's prior investment experience, product familiarity, or level of financial understanding, which is a required element under the framework. The recommendation rationale is reasonable but somewhat generic — the fund selection justification does not explicitly reference the client's specific financial situation or the interplay between the ISA and GIA tax treatment. Charges are partially disclosed (rates cited, but no monetary illustration and no reference to a formal CCI), and the full financial fact-find was not completed at this meeting. Alternatives were not documented. These gaps are remediable — most can be addressed via the financial fact-find and the suitability report — but as the note stands it is incomplete.",

He did not provide specific figures on his overall wealth position... my CfL assessment is based on his self-attestation that this sum is discretionary capital he could afford to lose without affecting his lifestyle. I would prefer to gather more detailed financial information at a follow-up meeting to strengthen this assessment.",
      "notes": "CfL is assessed as a distinct step from ATR, which is good. However, the assessment is explicitly unverified — the adviser notes the limitation and defers detailed assessment. Without specific income, asset, and liability data, the CfL assessment cannot be substantiated. Partial credit: the concept is applied, but the evidence base is insufficient for a required critical element."

Total liquid assets beyond this investment were not fully quantified.",

      "evidence": "This allocation is consistent with a Moderately Adventurous risk profile and aligns with a 10–15 year accumulation time horizon. The global equity allocation provides diversified growth exposure. The bond element provides some downside cushion. The property component adds a real asset diversifier.",
      "notes": "The rationale links the recommended allocation to the risk profile and time horizon, which is the core requirement. However, the justification is generic — it reads as a description of the asset classes rather than a client-specific rationale. It does not reference James's specific financial situation, income, or the tax treatment distinction between the ISA and GIA beyond a brief reference to the CGT annual exemption. Partial: the structure is present, the personalisation is weak."
