MEETING NOTE
Client: David Patel
Date: 14 February 2026
Adviser: S. Morris

---

Met with David today. He came in following an inheritance of around £50,000 from
his grandfather's estate. He wants to invest the money rather than leave it in the
bank. He said he's heard stocks and shares ISAs are a good option.

After speaking with him I recommended putting the £50,000 into a Stocks & Shares
ISA. I've split it across two funds: 80% Fundsmith Equity and 20% Baillie Gifford
Positive Change.

Fundsmith is a high-conviction global equity fund with a strong long-term track
record managed by Terry Smith. Baillie Gifford Positive Change invests in companies
targeting social and environmental improvements. Both funds are appropriate for
growth-oriented retail investors.

David seemed positive about the recommendation and said he would like to go ahead.
I told him I'd send over the paperwork.

Our adviser charge is 1% upfront and 0.5% ongoing. Platform charges also apply.

Next steps: send application forms.
