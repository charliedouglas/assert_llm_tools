      Client Meeting Note
      Client: Sarah Chen (ref SC-2241)
      Date: 10 January 2026
      Adviser: Daniel Wright
      Meeting type: Annual review — in-person at adviser's office
      Attendees: Daniel Wright (adviser), Sarah Chen (client)

      Client profile:
      Sarah is 54 years old, works as a GP (gross income £95,000 p.a.) and
      holds an NHS Pension (projected income £28,000/year from age 60) and
      a self-invested personal pension (SIPP, current value £186,000). No
      outstanding mortgage. Monthly discretionary spend ~£1,800; essential
      expenditure ~£2,200/month.

      Objectives:
      Primary objective: retire fully at 60, supplementing NHS pension with
      SIPP drawdown of £2,000/month. Secondary objective: IHT planning for
      estate (estimated £800k). Time horizon: 6 years to drawdown.

      Risk attitude:
      Sarah completed the firm's risk questionnaire (version 3.1) and scored
      41/60, placing her in the Balanced-Growth category. She confirmed the
      questionnaire outcome reflects her stated preferences. Limitations
      acknowledged: questionnaire uses hypothetical loss scenarios; adviser
      explored real-loss comfort separately and confirmed alignment.

      Capacity for loss:
      Assessed separately from ATR. Essential expenditure covered by income;
      NHS pension would cover living costs in full from age 60. SIPP losses
      of up to 25% would not affect living standards. CFL assessed as
      moderate-high. CFL does not constrain the Balanced-Growth ATR.

      Knowledge and experience:
      Sarah has held the SIPP for 12 years, previously consolidated two
      occupational pension schemes via an adviser. Familiar with fund-based
      investing. No direct equity experience. Assessed as adequate for
      recommended product type.

      Existing arrangements:
      SIPP reviewed. Current allocation: 60% global equity, 40% fixed income.
      Performance: +6.2% over 12 months vs benchmark +5.8%. Portfolio risk
      profile consistent with Balanced-Growth. No rebalancing required.

      Recommendation:
      No change to SIPP allocation. The 60/40 equity/bond split remains
      appropriate for Sarah's 6-year horizon to drawdown, Balanced-Growth
      (41/60) ATR, and moderate-high CFL. Income projection at current growth
      assumptions (5% nominal): ~£2,100/month at age 60 — within target range.
      No alternative strategy was identified as offering materially better
      alignment with her specific circumstances.

      Charges:
      Platform fee 0.15% p.a. Adviser fee 0.50% p.a. Weighted fund OCF
      0.38% p.a. Total 1.03% p.a. (~£1,916/year at current value). Costs
      discussed; confirmed fair value relative to services received under
      the annual review agreement.

      Vulnerability:
      No vulnerability indicators identified. Sarah engaged actively
      throughout and demonstrated clear understanding of all points discussed.

      Client understanding:
      Explained that performance cannot be guaranteed and that drawdown
      income is subject to sequence-of-returns risk. Sarah confirmed she
      understood the projection caveats and that she is comfortable with
      the plan. No changes to authorisations required.

      Actions:
      (1) Adviser to issue updated suitability report by 17 January 2026.
      (2) Next annual review: January 2027.

      Client: Robert Mills (ref RM-0091)
      Date: 5 February 2026
      Adviser: Kim Taylor
      Meeting type: Annual review

      Robert is 47, employed (income £52,000 p.a.). Holds ISA (£38,000)
      and workplace pension (£91,000). No mortgage.

      Objectives:
      Capital growth targeting retirement at 60. Target pension pot of
      £300,000 at age 60 to support drawdown. Time horizon: 13 years.

      Risk:
      Scored 38/60 on the firm's questionnaire — Balanced-Growth category.
      No conflict between score and discussion. Tool limitations noted.

      Capacity for loss:
      Robert has £15,000 in savings covering 8 months essential expenditure.
      Investment losses would not affect living standards. CFL moderate.

      Recommendation:
      Maintained existing Global Equity Fund ISA allocation. The fund suits
      Robert's 13-year growth horizon and Balanced-Growth (38/60) ATR; losses
      within his moderate CFL tolerance.

      Charges:
      OCF 0.22%, adviser 0.5%, platform 0.15%. Total 0.87% p.a.

      Client:
      Confirmed he had read the suitability report and understood the
      recommendation, including that values can fall.

      Client: Jennifer Park (ref JP-3301)
      Date: 12 February 2026
      Adviser: Tom Hughes
      Meeting type: Initial advice

      Jennifer is 52 and has received a redundancy payment of £75,000
      she wishes to invest for retirement.

      Objectives:
      Long-term growth to supplement retirement income. Time horizon:
      approximately 10 years.

      Risk:
      Jennifer is a balanced investor. She understands markets go up and
      down. She has some experience of ISA investing.

      Capacity for loss:
      Jennifer has some savings and can afford to take some risk with
      this sum.

      Recommendation:
      I recommended the Diversified Growth Fund. This is a well-regarded
      fund that matches your risk profile and investment objectives. It
      offers a good balance of risk and return. This recommendation is
      suitable for Jennifer based on her profile and circumstances.

      Charges:
      OCF 0.65%, adviser 0.5%. Total 1.15% p.a.

      Client signed the suitability letter and confirmed she was happy
      to proceed.

      Client: David Okafor (ref DO-7712)
      Date: 18 February 2026
      Adviser: Sophie Grant
      Meeting type: Retirement planning — initial advice

      David, 61, is retiring next year. Pension pot: £420,000.
      State pension from age 67. Savings: £12,000.

      Objectives:
      Generate income of £1,500/month in retirement to supplement state
      pension. Time horizon: 25+ years in drawdown.

      Risk assessment:
      David is cautious to moderate. He understands that investments can
      fall in value and is comfortable with short-term fluctuations
      provided long-term capital is preserved. He does not want to take
      excessive risk given his age and proximity to retirement.

      Recommendation:
      I recommended a multi-asset cautious portfolio with a 30/70
      equity/bond split. This suits David's cautious risk approach and
      income objective. The projected yield at 3.5% gives approximately
      £14,700/year, meeting the income target.

      Charges:
      OCF 0.55%, adviser 0.5%, platform 0.20%. Total 1.25% p.a.

      Client confirmed understanding of the recommendation.

      Client: Frances Abbott (ref FA-0054)
      Date: 20 January 2026
      Adviser: Mark Singh
      Meeting type: Annual review

      Frances, 49, teacher (income £38,000). ISA (£54,000), pension
      (£130,000). Mortgage: £85,000 outstanding (7 years remaining).

      Objectives:
      Retire at 58 with supplementary income of £1,200/month. Time
      horizon: 9 years to drawdown.

      Risk:
      Scored 33/60 on firm questionnaire — Balanced category. Limitations
      acknowledged; discussed actual loss scenarios separately.

      Capacity for loss:
      Mortgage payments manageable from income. £8,000 instant-access
      savings. Investment losses of up to 20% would not affect essential
      expenditure. CFL moderate, consistent with ATR.

      Recommendation:
      Increased equity allocation from 55% to 65% in both ISA and pension
      to target higher growth over the 9-year horizon. Aligns with Balanced
      (33/60) ATR and moderate CFL. Projected to produce the £1,200/month
      income target at age 58 at 5.5% nominal growth.

      Client: Helen Shaw (ref HS-1122)
      Date: 15 January 2026
      Adviser: James Cole
      Meeting type: Product review — ISA switch

      Helen, 44, marketing director (income £85,000). ISA with Provider A
      (current value £67,000, OCF 0.95% p.a.). No mortgage. Savings:
      £25,000 in instant-access account.

      Objectives:
      Long-term growth. Time horizon: 16 years to retirement at 60.

      Risk:
      Scored 46/60 — Growth category. Limitations acknowledged.

      Capacity for loss:
      £25,000 savings buffer covers 14 months essential expenditure.
      Investment losses of up to 30% would not affect living standards.
      CFL high, consistent with Growth ATR.

      Recommendation:
      Switch ISA from Provider A to Provider B. Provider B offers the
      same fund range at OCF 0.42% — saving £357/year at current value.
      The Growth portfolio allocation is unchanged: 80% global equity,
      20% fixed income. Switch recommended on cost grounds. Helen confirmed
      no specific features of Provider A she wished to retain.

      Charges post-switch:
      OCF 0.42%, adviser 0.5%, platform 0.18%. Total 1.10% p.a.
      Previous total: 1.65% p.a. Switch cost: nil (in-specie transfer).
