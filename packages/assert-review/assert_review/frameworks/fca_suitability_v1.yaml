name: FCA Suitability Note Framework
version: 1.0.0
regulator: FCA
description: >
  Defines the required elements for a suitability note produced under
  COBS 9.2 (Suitability Reports) when providing personal recommendations
  on retail investment products.
effective_date: "2024-01-01"
reference: "COBS 9.2 / PS13/1"

elements:

  - id: client_objectives
    description: >
      The note must document the client's investment objectives, including
      time horizon, purpose of investment (e.g. retirement, income, growth),
      and any specific goals or constraints stated by the client.
    required: true
    severity: critical
    guidance: >
      Look for explicit statements of what the client wants to achieve,
      not just a product recommendation. Phrases like "client seeks",
      "investment goal", "target date", "income requirement" are strong signals.

  - id: risk_attitude
    description: >
      The note must record the client's attitude to risk (ATR) including
      the outcome of any risk profiling exercise and the assigned risk
      category (e.g. cautious, balanced, adventurous).
    required: true
    severity: critical
    guidance: >
      Look for a named risk category, a score from a risk questionnaire,
      or explicit adviser assessment of risk tolerance. Absence of any
      risk language is a clear gap.

  - id: capacity_for_loss
    description: >
      The note must distinguish capacity for loss from attitude to risk,
      documenting whether the client can financially sustain a loss of
      capital without materially impacting their standard of living.
    required: true
    severity: critical
    guidance: >
      This is distinct from ATR. Look for references to disposable income,
      emergency funds, essential expenditure, or a statement that losses
      would/would not affect living standards.

  - id: financial_situation
    description: >
      The note must summarise the client's financial position including
      income, expenditure, assets, liabilities, and any existing investment
      holdings relevant to the recommendation.
    required: true
    severity: high
    guidance: >
      Income and expenditure figures, pension values, savings balances,
      mortgage details, or a statement of net worth all qualify. A generic
      "financial situation reviewed" with no supporting detail is insufficient.

  - id: knowledge_and_experience
    description: >
      The note must record the client's knowledge of and experience with
      the relevant investment type, per MiFID II appropriateness principles
      as applied under FCA rules.
    required: true
    severity: high
    guidance: >
      Look for assessment of prior investment experience (e.g. "client has
      held ISAs for 10 years"), product familiarity, or educational background
      in finance. Note any limitations or gaps the adviser identified.

  - id: recommendation_rationale
    description: >
      The note must explain why the recommended product(s) are suitable for
      this specific client, linking the recommendation explicitly back to the
      client's objectives, risk profile, and financial situation.
    required: true
    severity: critical
    guidance: >
      Generic product descriptions do not count. The rationale must be
      personalised: "this fund was selected because..." tied to the client's
      documented profile. Look for causal language linking client attributes
      to the recommendation.

  - id: charges_and_costs
    description: >
      The note must disclose all relevant charges and costs associated with
      the recommended product(s) and the advice service, including ongoing
      and one-off fees.
    required: true
    severity: high
    guidance: >
      Look for percentage or monetary figures for product charges (OCF, AMC),
      platform fees, and adviser fees. A statement that costs were "discussed
      separately" may be acceptable if cross-referenced to a costs disclosure doc.

  - id: alternatives_considered
    description: >
      The note should record that the adviser considered alternative products
      or strategies, and explain why the recommendation was preferred.
    required: false
    severity: medium
    guidance: >
      May be implicit ("this product was selected over alternatives because...")
      or explicit (a comparison table). Complete absence is a gap but not
      automatically a breach.

  - id: client_confirmation
    description: >
      The note should record that the client received, understood, and
      acknowledged the recommendation, or that the recommendation was
      discussed with the client.
    required: false
    severity: low
    guidance: >
      May be a signature reference, verbal confirmation note, or statement
      that the report was issued and accepted. Absence is minor but noteworthy.
