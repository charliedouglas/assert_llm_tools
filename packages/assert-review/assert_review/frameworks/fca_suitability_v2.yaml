description: >
  Defines required and recommended documentation elements for wealth management
  meeting notes produced under FCA rules, including COBS 9/9A (suitability),
  SYSC 9 (record-keeping), MiFID II (conduct of business), Consumer Duty
  (Principle 12 / PRIN 2A), and associated FCA guidance. Covers all meeting
  types including advice meetings, annual reviews, ad-hoc client contact,
  and onboarding. Firms should enable or disable elements based on their
  compliance framework and CRM infrastructure.

severity_scale:
  critical: >
    Absence constitutes probable regulatory breach. Cited in majority of
    FCA enforcement actions. Missing element means the note cannot
    demonstrate compliance with core suitability or conduct obligations.
  warning: >
    Strongly expected under FCA rules or guidance. Absence creates material
    risk of regulatory criticism, particularly under Consumer Duty. Cited
    in thematic reviews and emerging enforcement actions.
  info: >
    Represents good practice or emerging regulatory expectation. Not yet
    subject to standalone enforcement but on a clear trajectory toward
    higher severity as FCA's Consumer Duty programme matures.

  - id: client_identification
    description: >
      The note must identify the client(s) to whom the meeting relates,
      including full name(s) and any relevant reference identifiers.
      For joint clients, both parties should be identified with notation
      of who was present. Third parties (solicitors, accountants, power
      of attorney holders) should be named with their roles.
    required: true
    severity: critical
    regulatory_basis: >
      SYSC 9.1.1R (records sufficient for FCA monitoring);
      COBS 9A.4 (customer information records);
      MiFID II Article 16(7) (face-to-face meeting records).
    guidance: >
      Look for client name, reference number, and client classification
      (retail/professional). For joint accounts, verify both parties are
      identified. Without client identification, no record has regulatory
      value. Note: if the note is attached to a CRM client record, the
      firm may consider structural identification sufficient — but the
      note should still be interpretable in isolation.
    discriminating_criteria:
      required_specificity:
        - "States the client's full name (first and last name, not just a reference number)"
        - "For joint clients: identifies both parties and notes who was present at the meeting"
      pass_example: >
        "Client: Margaret Thornton (ref MT-4421). Annual review. Attendees:
        James Patel (adviser), Margaret Thornton (client)."
      fail_example: >
        "Meeting with client." or "Annual review conducted." — no name,
        no identification of who was present.

  - id: client_objectives
    description: >
      The note must document the client's investment objectives, including
      time horizon, purpose of investment (e.g. retirement, income, growth,
      capital preservation), and any specific goals or constraints. Objectives
      should be quantified where possible with target amounts and dates.
      Where objectives are unchanged from a prior meeting, the note must
      confirm they were reviewed and remain current rather than remaining
      silent.
    required: true
    severity: critical
    regulatory_basis: >
      COBS 9.2.2R(2) (purpose of investment, time horizon, risk preferences);
      MiFID II Delegated Regulation Article 54(7) (adequate and up-to-date
      information for ongoing advice);
      Article 54(12) (suitability reports must reference investment term);
      FG11/5 para 3.15 (different objectives assessed separately).
    guidance: >
      Look for explicit statements of what the client wants to achieve —
      phrases like "client seeks", "investment goal", "target date", "income
      requirement" are strong signals. Single-word objectives ("growth",
      "retirement") without quantification, time horizon, or income
      specification are insufficient per FG11/5. For review meetings,
      "objectives reviewed, confirmed unchanged" is acceptable; silence
      is not. FCA treats unclear or undocumented objectives as automatic
      COBS 9.2 breaches.
    discriminating_criteria:
      required_specificity:
        - "States a specific income target or capital goal in monetary terms — not just 'growth' or 'income'"
        - "States a specific time horizon as an age, calendar date, or number of years — not just 'long term'"
        - "For review meetings: explicitly confirms objectives were reviewed and are current, rather than being silent"
      pass_example: >
        "Primary goal: income supplement of £800–£1,000/month from age 62,
        preserving residual capital for IHT gifting to two adult children.
        Time horizon: 4 years to drawdown commencement."
      fail_example: >
        "Client's objective is long-term growth with some income." — no
        monetary target, no specific time horizon, no link to client
        circumstances.

  - id: risk_attitude
    description: >
      The note must record the client's attitude to risk (ATR), including
      the outcome of any risk profiling exercise and the assigned risk
      category. Where a risk profiling tool was used, its limitations
      should be acknowledged. This element must be documented separately
      from capacity for loss. Where ATR conflicts with capacity for loss,
      the resolution must be documented.
    required: true
    severity: critical
    regulatory_basis: >
      COBS 9.2.2R(1) (client's preferences regarding risk taking and
      risk profile);
      MiFID II Article 25(2) (risk tolerance as separate requirement);
      FG11/5 (firms should use separate processes for ATR and CFL;
      9 of 11 risk profiling tools reviewed had weaknesses producing
      flawed outputs).
    guidance: >
      Look for a named risk category, a score from a risk questionnaire,
      or explicit adviser assessment of risk tolerance. FG11/5 criticised
      firms that conflated ATR and CFL into single automated outputs and
      firms that relied on questionnaires without understanding tool
      limitations. Non-committal "middle" answers on questionnaires
      should not be interpreted as neutral risk appetite without further
      exploration. Absence of any risk language in an advice note is a
      clear gap cited in 100% of enforcement cases reviewed.
    discriminating_criteria:
      required_specificity:
        - "Names the risk category assigned (e.g. 'Balanced', 'Growth', 'Cautious') — not just 'medium risk'"
        - "Names or describes the profiling method used (e.g. 'firm questionnaire', 'FinaMetrica', 'adviser assessment')"
        - "Includes a score, band, or indicator from the profiling exercise, not just a label"
        - "Acknowledges at least one limitation of the tool or assessment process"
      pass_example: >
        "Margaret scored 34/60 on the firm's risk questionnaire (v3.1),
        placing her in the Balanced category. Questionnaire limitations
        discussed — hypothetical loss scenarios may not reflect real-world
        behaviour; adviser explored actual loss comfort separately and
        confirmed alignment."
      fail_example: >
        "Client is medium risk and comfortable with some market fluctuation."
        — no named category, no score, no tool referenced, no limitations
        acknowledged.

  - id: capacity_for_loss
    description: >
      The note must document a separate assessment of the client's capacity
      for loss — their ability to financially absorb falls in the value of
      their investments without materially impacting their standard of living.
      This must not be conflated with attitude to risk. Where capacity for
      loss is low but stated risk appetite is high, CFL must be the binding
      constraint, and the reasoning must be documented.
    required: true
    severity: critical
    regulatory_basis: >
      COBS 9.2.2R(1)(b) (able financially to bear related investment risks);
      MiFID II Article 25(2) (ability to bear losses as separate requirement);
      FG11/5 (unambiguous that CFL must be assessed separately from ATR;
      identified conflation as most criticised documentation practice across
      a decade of thematic reviews).
    guidance: >
      This is distinct from ATR. Look for references to disposable income,
      emergency funds, essential expenditure, dependants' needs, or an
      explicit statement that losses would or would not affect living
      standards. FG11/5 states that where a customer does not have capacity
      to sustain potential loss, the firm must explain that higher returns
      cannot realistically be met. The single most impactful correction
      a firm can make is ensuring CFL is never conflated with ATR.
    discriminating_criteria:
      required_specificity:
        - "Addresses CFL as a concept separate from ATR — uses distinct language or appears in a separate section"
        - "References a concrete financial buffer: months of essential expenditure covered, liquid savings amount, or income surplus"
        - "States explicitly whether investment losses would or would not affect the client's standard of living"
      pass_example: >
        "CFL assessed separately from ATR. Margaret holds £28,000 in liquid
        savings (cash ISA and current account), covering 18 months of
        essential expenditure. Investment losses up to 25% would not affect
        her living standards. CFL assessed as moderate — does not constrain
        the Balanced ATR."
      fail_example: >
        "Client understands investments can fall in value and is comfortable
        with short-term volatility provided long-term goals are preserved."
        — this describes ATR, not CFL; no financial buffer, no living
        standards assessment.

  - id: recommendation_rationale
    description: >
      The note must explain why the recommended product(s) or course of
      action is suitable for this specific client, linking the recommendation
      explicitly to the client's objectives, risk profile, capacity for loss,
      knowledge and experience, and financial situation. Generic product
      descriptions do not satisfy this requirement. For review meetings where
      existing arrangements are confirmed as suitable, the note must explain
      why they remain so rather than simply stating the conclusion.
    required: true
    severity: critical
    regulatory_basis: >
      COBS 9.4.7R (suitability reports must explain why recommendation suitable);
      COBS 9A.3.2R / MiFID II Delegated Regulation Article 54(12) (outline of
      advice given, how recommendation meets objectives with reference to
      investment term, knowledge and experience, attitude to risk, and
      capacity for loss);
      Consumer Duty PRIN 2A (act to deliver good outcomes).
    guidance: >
      This element has the highest enforcement scrutiny of any element — cited
      in 100% of FCA enforcement cases reviewed. The rationale must reference
      all four MiFID II dimensions: objectives (including term), knowledge
      and experience, attitude to risk, and capacity for loss. "This fund
      matches your risk profile" is insufficient — it fails to address
      objectives, time horizon, and capacity for loss. For independent
      advisers, COBS 6.2A requires assessment of a sufficiently diverse
      range. For replacement business, FG12/16 requires documented comparison
      of existing vs proposed arrangements including cost, features, and
      any loss of guarantees. A bare statement that "existing portfolio
      remains suitable" without supporting reasoning risks an "unclear"
      FCA rating.
    discriminating_criteria:
      required_specificity:
        - "Names the specific product, fund, or strategy being recommended — not 'a suitable investment'"
        - "Links the recommendation explicitly to the client's named time horizon (specific age, date, or number of years)"
        - "References the client's specific risk score or named category from the profiling exercise"
        - "Addresses capacity for loss as a documented constraint on the recommendation, distinct from ATR"
        - "For product switches or replacement business: compares old vs new arrangement on cost, features, and any benefits surrendered"
        - "For review meetings where no change is made: explains WHY existing arrangements remain suitable — not just states the conclusion"
      pass_example: >
        "Recommended switching the ISA to Provider X and commencing phased
        pension drawdown from age 62. The ISA switch reduces the ongoing
        charge from 0.85% to 0.45% (saving ~£640/year) with no change to
        the fund or risk profile. Drawdown of £1,000/month from age 62 is
        consistent with Margaret's income objective, her 4-year time horizon,
        Balanced (34/60) ATR, and moderate CFL (constrained by £28k liquid
        buffer). No guaranteed benefits are surrendered."
      fail_example: >
        "This recommendation is suitable for the client based on her risk
        profile and investment objectives." — no named product, no time
        horizon, no risk score, no CFL linkage, no client-specific
        circumstances.

  - id: meeting_context
    description: >
      The note should record the date of the meeting, all attendees and
      their roles, the meeting type (initial advice, annual review, ad-hoc),
      and the channel (face-to-face, telephone, video). For telephone
      meetings, firms should note that the call was recorded per SYSC 10A
      where applicable.
    required: true
    severity: warning
    regulatory_basis: >
      MiFID II Article 16(7) (channel determines recording obligations);
      MiFID II Delegated Regulation Article 76 (recording policies);
      COBS 9A.4 (when and how information was obtained);
      SM&CR (adviser identification for accountability).
    guidance: >
      Date and client attendees are the most important sub-elements — without
      temporal ordering and participant identification, the note has limited
      regulatory value. Firm attendees and adviser identity support SM&CR
      accountability but may be determinable from other records. Channel
      and location are relevant because they determine MiFID II Article 76
      recording obligations. Meeting type provides helpful context but is
      not explicitly mandated.

  - id: financial_situation
    description: >
      The note should summarise the client's relevant financial position
      including income, expenditure, assets, liabilities, and any existing
      investment holdings material to the discussion. A full financial fact
      find is not required in every meeting note, but changes to financial
      circumstances must be captured, and for new recommendations the
      financial context supporting the advice must be evident.
    required: true
    severity: warning
    regulatory_basis: >
      COBS 9.2.1R (suitability assessment based on client's existing
      financial situation);
      COBS 9.2.2R(1)(a) (information about financial situation including
      ability to bear losses);
      MiFID II Delegated Regulation Article 54(5) (source and extent of
      regular income, assets, investments, real property).
    guidance: >
      Income and expenditure figures, pension values, savings balances,
      mortgage details, or a statement of net worth all qualify. For review
      meetings, "financial situation reviewed — no material changes since
      last review" is acceptable if the underlying fact find is maintained
      elsewhere. A generic "financial situation reviewed" with no supporting
      detail and no cross-reference is insufficient. The financial situation
      underpins both suitability and capacity for loss assessments.

  - id: knowledge_and_experience
    description: >
      The note should record the client's knowledge of and experience with
      the relevant investment types, particularly where complex or higher-risk
      products are discussed. Any limitations or gaps the adviser identified
      should be noted, along with how they were addressed.
    required: true
    severity: warning
    regulatory_basis: >
      COBS 9.2.2R(1)(c) (knowledge and experience in the investment field
      relevant to the specific type of product or service);
      MiFID II Delegated Regulation Article 54(3)-(4) (types of service,
      transaction and financial instrument with which client is familiar;
      nature, volume, frequency of transactions).
    guidance: >
      Look for assessment of prior investment experience (e.g. "client has
      held ISAs for 10 years"), product familiarity, educational background,
      or professional experience in finance. Where the client has limited
      experience with a recommended product type, the note should record
      how this was addressed (explanation provided, simpler alternative
      considered). For ongoing clients, brief confirmation that experience
      level remains as previously assessed is acceptable.

  - id: existing_arrangements
    description: >
      The note should record a review of the client's existing investments
      and financial arrangements, including current values, performance
      against objectives, risk alignment, and whether existing arrangements
      remain suitable. For annual reviews, this is a core obligation.
    required: true
    severity: warning
    regulatory_basis: >
      COBS 9.2.1R (suitability assessment based on existing financial situation);
      MiFID II Delegated Regulation Article 54(13) (periodic suitability
      assessment at least annually for ongoing relationships);
      Consumer Duty PRIN 2A.4 (price and value outcome — fair value
      assessment of ongoing services);
      FCA October 2024 portfolio letter (concerns about ongoing advice fees
      without delivery of services).
    guidance: >
      Look for current holdings with values, performance against benchmarks
      or objectives, risk profile of portfolio versus ATR, and whether
      arrangements remain suitable. TR15/12 found one-third of wealth
      management firms fell substantially short of expected standards. For
      annual reviews, failure to review existing arrangements constitutes
      breach of Article 54(13) and Consumer Duty fair value requirements,
      elevating this element toward critical severity in that context.

  - id: charges_and_costs
    description: >
      The note should evidence that charges and costs were discussed,
      including product charges (OCF, AMC), platform fees, adviser fees,
      and any transaction costs. Separate cost disclosure documents should
      be referenced. Under Consumer Duty, fair value must be considered —
      not merely cost quantum.
    required: true
    severity: warning
    regulatory_basis: >
      COBS 6.1ZA.11R-12R / MiFID II Article 50 (aggregated cost disclosure
      in cash and percentage terms);
      COBS 6.1A.24R (total adviser charges in cash terms before contract);
      Consumer Duty PRIN 2A.4 (price and value outcome);
      TR14/21 (36% of wealth management firms failed initial charge
      disclosure; 50% failed ongoing charge disclosure).
    guidance: >
      Look for percentage or monetary figures, or a cross-reference to a
      separate ex-ante or ex-post cost disclosure document. Under Consumer
      Duty, confirmation that costs represent fair value relative to benefits
      received strengthens the note. For annual reviews, COBS 6.1ZA.12R
      requires cost information at least annually — even a "no change"
      review should confirm charges were reviewed and remain fair value.
      For new recommendations, full ex-ante disclosure is a hard rule.

  - id: vulnerability_indicators
    description: >
      The note should record any indicators of client vulnerability observed
      or disclosed during the meeting, across the four FCA-defined drivers:
      health, life events, resilience, and capability. Where no indicators
      are identified, a brief positive confirmation is strongly recommended.
      Vulnerability should be recorded using factual language about
      circumstances and adjustments made, not labels.
    required: true
    severity: warning
    regulatory_basis: >
      FG21/1 (four vulnerability drivers: health, life events, resilience,
      capability);
      Consumer Duty PS22/9 (consider needs of customers with characteristics
      of vulnerability at every stage);
      FCA 2025/26 strategy (explicit focus on wealth manager vulnerability
      identification — 49% of wealth firms had not identified any vulnerable
      clients, less than 1% of retail clients reported as vulnerable).
    guidance: >
      This is not a checklist — FG21/1 explicitly states so. However, the
      direction of travel strongly favours active documentation. FCA's
      March 2025 multi-firm review criticised binary approaches to
      vulnerability identification. Do not use the word "vulnerable" in
      client-facing records per FG21/1 para 2.9. Use factual language:
      "Client disclosed recent bereavement — adjusted pace of meeting
      and offered follow-up call." Where no indicators observed: "No
      vulnerability indicators identified during this meeting." Severity
      is on a clear trajectory toward critical as Consumer Duty enforcement
      matures, particularly for onboarding and life event meetings.
    severity_trajectory: escalating

  - id: actions_and_next_steps
    description: >
      The note should record all agreed actions with owners and target
      dates, including adviser actions (rebalancing, applications, research),
      client actions (providing documents, consulting other advisers), and
      the date of the next scheduled review. Where no actions arise, this
      should be explicitly stated.
    required: true
    severity: warning
    regulatory_basis: >
      SYSC 9.1.1R (records sufficient to demonstrate compliance);
      COBS 2.1.1R (best interests — creating obligation to follow through);
      Consumer Duty PRIN 2A (enable and support customers to pursue
      financial objectives);
      FCA 2025 ongoing services review (poor practice: ineffective
      processes to ensure services delivered as agreed).
    guidance: >
      Look for specific, attributed actions with timeframes. "Actions:
      (1) Adviser to rebalance portfolio — by 15 March. (2) Client to
      provide pension statement — by end of month." is strong. Where no
      actions arise: "No actions required — existing arrangements confirmed
      suitable." Consumer Duty's "enable and support" requirement means
      vague or unattributed actions weaken the note.

  - id: client_understanding
    description: >
      The note should record that the client received, understood, and
      acknowledged the advice or information provided. Post-Consumer Duty,
      mere agreement is insufficient — the note should evidence that the
      client understood what they were agreeing to, including key risks
      and any disadvantages. For joint clients with different understanding
      levels, each client's comprehension should be noted.
    required: true
    severity: warning
    regulatory_basis: >
      COBS 9.4.7R (suitability reports must explain disadvantages);
      Consumer Duty PRIN 2A.5 / FG22/5 §8 (consumer understanding outcome —
      communications must equip consumers to make effective, timely and
      properly informed decisions);
      COBS 9.4.11R (pension transfers — signed confirmation of understanding
      explicitly required).
    guidance: >
      "Client happy to proceed" is almost certainly insufficient post-Consumer
      Duty. FCA notes 91% of people consent to terms they haven't read.
      Stronger: "Explained that switching would crystallise a CGT liability
      and lose the existing product's guaranteed annuity rate. Client
      confirmed they understood both points and wished to proceed."
      For routine reviews with no changes, verbal confirmation documented
      contemporaneously suffices. For significant recommendations (pension
      transfers, high-risk investments), this element approaches critical
      severity.

  - id: tax_considerations
    description: >
      The note should record that relevant tax implications of the
      recommendation or financial strategy were considered and discussed
      with the client, without the adviser providing specific tax advice.
      For pension access or transfers, tax disclosure is a hard regulatory
      requirement.
    required: true
    severity: warning
    regulatory_basis: >
      FG12/16 (tax is one of three main factors dictating investment return
      alongside charges and performance — firms expected to consider all
      three);
      COBS 19.4.18R (hard rule: description of tax implications required
      before client accesses pension savings);
      Multiple FOS decisions upheld complaints where tax implications
      not considered.
    guidance: >
      Acceptable: "Discussed that proposed withdrawal may be subject to
      income tax at client's marginal rate. Client advised to consult
      accountant regarding IHT implications." Unacceptable: providing
      specific tax calculations without appropriate qualifications, or
      silence on tax where a recommendation has clear tax consequences.
      For pension access or transfer advice, COBS 19.4.18R makes tax
      disclosure mandatory — severity effectively elevates to critical
      in that context. For general investment reviews with no tax-
      triggering events, brief confirmation that no tax implications
      arise is sufficient.

      The note should record that the adviser considered alternative
      products or strategies and explain why the recommendation was
      preferred. For independent advisers, this supports the COBS 6.2A
      obligation to assess a sufficiently diverse range. For replacement
      business, documented comparison is expected per FG12/16.

      FG12/16 (replacement business — documented comparison of existing
      vs proposed including cost, features, loss of guarantees);

      alternatives).

      May be implicit ("this product was selected because...") or explicit
      (a comparison or shortlist). Complete absence is a gap but not
      automatically a breach for ongoing reviews where arrangements are
      unchanged. For replacement business (switching, transfers), this
      element's importance rises significantly — FG12/16 makes comparison
      an expectation, and multiple enforcement actions cite failure to
      consider alternatives.

      The note should record whether the client's sustainability or ESG

      Note: UK has NOT onshored EU MiFID II ESG suitability amendments
      (Commission Delegated Regulation 2021/1253). No UK rule currently
      requires collection of sustainability preferences as part of
      suitability assessment. PS23/16 (SDR) is a product-labelling regime.
      FCA anti-greenwashing rule (effective May 2024) applies to
      communications, not suitability processes. CP24/8 proposes extending
      SDR to portfolio management but remains consultative.
    guidance: >
      No enforcement action for ESG documentation failures to date.
      However, regulatory trajectory (SDR extension, anti-greenwashing
      maturation) means this element is likely to escalate. Good practice:
      "Sustainability preferences discussed. Client expressed interest in
      avoiding fossil fuel investments. Preferences secondary to financial
      return objectives." Even where no preference: "Adviser raised
      sustainability preferences. Client confirmed no specific preferences
      at this time."

      The note should record confirmation that no material conflicts of
      interest exist, or disclose any specific conflicts and how they
      are being managed. Particularly relevant where the firm has
      proprietary products, revenue-sharing arrangements, or where
      contingent charging models apply.

      SYSC 10 (conflicts of interest management);
      COBS 6.1A (adviser charging — disclosure of remuneration);
      FCA enforcement actions citing undisclosed conflicts as aggravating
      factors (IFM contingent charging, SVS Securities undisclosed
      commissions).
    guidance: >
      A brief confirmation — "No material conflicts identified" — represents
      good practice. Where conflicts exist (e.g. adviser recommending
      in-house funds, contingent charging on pension transfers), explicit
      disclosure and management approach should be documented. Absence is
      not a standalone enforcement trigger but presence strengthens the
      overall quality of the record.

      For review meetings, the note should reference the client's ongoing
      service agreement level and confirm that this meeting constitutes

      Consumer Duty PRIN 2A.4 (price and value outcome);
      FCA October 2024 portfolio letter (90% of new clients in ongoing
      advice; revenue from ongoing advice rose from 60% to 80% between
      2016-2023; concerns about fees charged without services delivered);
      FCA 2025 ongoing advice review (firms must evidence delivery of
      agreed services).
    guidance: >
      Look for reference to service tier (e.g. "Premium service — two
      reviews per annum"), confirmation that this meeting is part of the
      agreed service, and that fees remain aligned. FCA has explicitly
      flagged firms charging ongoing advice fees without delivering
      ongoing advice — and even charging fees for deceased customers.
      This element supports Consumer Duty fair value evidence and is
      likely to increase in importance.
