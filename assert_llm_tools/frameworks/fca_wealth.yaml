  management context, covering personal recommendations on retail investment
  products under COBS 9.2, Consumer Duty obligations (PRIN 2A / PS22/9),
  MiFID II suitability and costs & charges requirements, and Anti-Money

elements:

  - id: client_id
    description: >
      The note must evidence that the client's identity has been verified in
      accordance with Anti-Money Laundering regulations (MLR 2017) and the
      firm's Customer Due Diligence (CDD) or Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD)
      procedures. This includes recording the type of documentation reviewed,
      any reference numbers, and the outcome of PEP/sanctions screening where
      applicable.
    required: true
    severity: critical
    guidance: >
      Look for explicit reference to documents seen (passport, driving licence,
      utility bill), document reference numbers, date of verification, and PEP
      or sanctions screening outcome. A bare statement such as "ID on file" is
      insufficient for a new client engagement. EDD must be evidenced where the
      client is a PEP, HNW individual with complex source-of-wealth, or the
      transaction carries elevated ML risk.
    examples:
      - "Client identity verified against current passport (doc ref: P123456GB) and utility bill dated 03/01/2026. Standard CDD completed. PEP/sanctions screening: clear (date: 14/02/2026, provider: ComplyAdvantage)."
      - "Enhanced due diligence applied — client identified as PEP (retired senior public official). Source of wealth confirmed as proceeds of property portfolio sale; supporting documentation reviewed and retained on file."
      - "Existing client re-verification completed following 24-month trigger review. Driving licence (DOUG9...) sighted and re-recorded. No change in risk classification."
    anti_patterns:
      - "ID checked."
      - "KYC complete — details on file."
      - "Client identity confirmed."

  - id: meeting_context
    description: >
      The note must document the context of the meeting or interaction,
      including: the date, format (in-person, telephone, video), location or
      platform, the purpose of the meeting, all parties present (including any
      third parties such as a spouse, attorney, or interpreter), and whether
      the client initiated the meeting or was contacted by the adviser.
    required: true
    severity: high
    guidance: >
      Meeting context establishes the basis for the advice and is essential for
      supervisory review. Purpose should be stated specifically (e.g. "retirement
      planning review" not just "review"). Where a third party was present,
      document any consent given for their attendance and, if they participated in
      the discussion, note their role. Consumer Duty requires firms to evidence
      that communications are clear and appropriate — the format and context of
      the meeting is part of that record.
    examples:
      - "Annual review meeting held in person at client's home, 14/02/2026, 10:00–11:30. Client and spouse (Mrs A Douglas, also a client) present. Purpose: to reassess portfolio suitability following client's retirement in December 2025 and review income drawdown strategy."
      - "Initial financial planning meeting held via video call (Teams), 14/02/2026. Client attended alone. Purpose: to discuss investment of inheritance proceeds (approximately £350,000) received following bereavement. Client-initiated enquiry via website."
      - "Ad hoc telephone call, 14/02/2026, 14:15. Client called to discuss concerns about market volatility and whether portfolio rebalancing was required. No formal recommendation made during this call; follow-up meeting scheduled."
    anti_patterns:
      - "Meeting held with client."
      - "Annual review completed 14/02/2026."
      - "Client attended — discussed portfolio."

  - id: objectives
    description: >
      The note must document the client's investment objectives in specific,
      measurable terms where possible. This includes: the primary purpose of the
      investment (e.g. retirement income, wealth accumulation, legacy/IHT
      planning, school fees), the investment time horizon, any specific capital
      or income targets, liquidity requirements, and any constraints or
      preferences expressed by the client.
    required: true
    severity: critical
    guidance: >
      Generic statements such as "growth" or "long-term investment" are
      insufficient. Objectives should be personalised and, where possible,
      quantified. Time horizon must be documented explicitly — it drives asset
      allocation and suitability of illiquid investments. Where objectives have
      changed since the last review, document what changed and why. Multiple or
      competing objectives (e.g. income now vs. capital growth) should each be
      recorded with relative priority.
    examples:
      - "Primary objective: accumulate a retirement fund sufficient to support £30,000 pa gross income from age 65 (11 years). Secondary objective: preserve capital in real terms for estate planning purposes. No immediate income requirement. Liquidity: client requires access to £10,000 at short notice as emergency reserve (held outside this portfolio)."
      - "Client's objective is to invest a lump sum inheritance of £280,000 for long-term growth over a 15–20 year horizon with no income requirement. Client wishes to pass wealth to children and has expressed interest in IHT-efficient structures. No capital access required within the investment period."
      - "Objectives revised since last review: client retired December 2025. Prior objective (accumulation) now transitioning to decumulation — target sustainable income of £18,000 pa from SIPP drawdown to supplement state pension (£11,502 pa). Capital preservation now elevated in priority."
    anti_patterns:
      - "Client wants long-term growth."
      - "Retirement planning discussed."
      - "Client's objectives noted."

  - id: risk_tolerance
    description: >
      The note must document both the client's Attitude to Risk (ATR) and their
      Capacity for Loss (CfL) as distinct assessments. ATR reflects the client's
      psychological willingness to accept investment risk; CfL reflects their
      financial ability to sustain a loss of capital without materially affecting
      their standard of living. In a wealth management context these must be
      assessed in combination and reconciled where they diverge.
    required: true
    severity: critical
    guidance: >
      A risk profile label alone (e.g. "balanced") is insufficient without
      supporting evidence of the assessment process. Record the tool used for
      ATR (e.g. Dynamic Planner, Oxford Risk, FinaMetrica) and the resulting
      score or category. CfL must be assessed separately, referencing the
      client's income, expenditure, liquid reserves, and essential financial
      commitments. Where ATR and CfL are misaligned (e.g. high ATR but low CfL),
      document how the conflict was resolved and which was treated as the binding
      constraint. Do not allow a high ATR to override a low CfL.
    examples:
      - "ATR assessed via Dynamic Planner questionnaire: score 6/10 (Moderately Adventurous). CfL: high — client has £60,000 liquid cash reserves, no mortgage, pension income covers essential expenditure, and investment capital represents discretionary wealth. ATR and CfL aligned; no conflict to resolve. Recommended risk level: Moderately Adventurous."
      - "ATR (Oxford Risk): Balanced (score 52/100). CfL: medium — client's primary income is employment salary (£85,000 pa); investment represents 40% of net worth with remaining assets in illiquid property. Client confirmed a 20% portfolio loss would not affect lifestyle but a 30%+ loss would cause moderate stress. CfL treated as binding constraint; portfolio positioned at lower end of balanced range."
      - "Client's ATR assessed as Adventurous (DP score 8). However, CfL assessed as low-medium: client recently divorced, reduced income, and this ISA represents the majority of liquid assets. ATR overridden by CfL — portfolio positioned at Balanced. Rationale explained to client and documented; client accepted the adviser's assessment."
    anti_patterns:
      - "Risk profile: balanced."
      - "Client is comfortable with investment risk."
      - "ATR questionnaire completed — results on file."

  - id: suitability_rationale
    description: >
      The note must explain, in personalised terms, why the specific
      recommendation(s) made are suitable for this particular client at this
      time. The rationale must draw explicit connections between the client's
      documented objectives, risk profile, capacity for loss, financial
      situation, and the characteristics of the recommended product(s) or
      strategy. Generic product descriptions do not satisfy this requirement.
    required: true
    severity: critical
    guidance: >
      The rationale must be demonstrably client-specific — a reviewer should not
      be able to apply it verbatim to a different client. Use causal language
      linking client attributes to the recommendation: "because the client...",
      "given the client's... this fund was selected...". Where a recommendation
      involves switching from an existing holding, the rationale must explain
      why the switch is in the client's best interest and consider exit charges,
      tax implications, and loss of benefits. Under Consumer Duty, the firm must
      be satisfied that the recommendation delivers good outcomes, not merely
      that it is technically suitable.
    examples:
      - "The recommended portfolio (65% global equity / 35% investment grade bonds, implemented via Vanguard LifeStrategy 60% Equity and Rathbone Greenbank Global Sustainability Fund) is suitable because: (1) the equity/bond split aligns with the client's Balanced risk profile; (2) the 15-year time horizon supports equity exposure without undue short-term risk; (3) low OCF (0.27% blended) preserves returns relative to the client's growth target; and (4) the ESG overlay reflects the client's documented sustainability preferences."
      - "Drawdown recommended in preference to annuity because: client has defined benefit pension providing guaranteed income floor (£14,000 pa); remaining SIPP capital (£220,000) can therefore be invested with a higher risk tolerance; client values flexibility for ad hoc withdrawals; death benefit considerations (client wishes to pass residual SIPP to adult children). Annuity quotations obtained and reviewed — best annuity rate (£9,800 pa level) considered insufficient given the flexibility and death benefit trade-off."
      - "Consolidation of three legacy pension pots to AJ Bell SIPP recommended because: (1) simplified ongoing management; (2) consolidated value (£94,000) meets minimum for preferred investment range; (3) no guaranteed annuity rates or enhanced transfer values lost (confirmed in writing from each ceding scheme); (4) platform charge on consolidated basis (0.25%) lower than weighted average of existing charges (0.41%)."
    anti_patterns:
      - "This fund is recommended as suitable for the client's needs."
      - "The recommended portfolio matches the client's risk profile."
      - "Product is appropriate given the client's objectives."

  - id: vulnerability
    description: >
      Under Consumer Duty (PRIN 2A) and FCA Guidance (FG21/1), the note must
      evidence that the adviser assessed whether the client may be vulnerable and
      that appropriate adjustments were made where vulnerability was identified
      or suspected. This includes assessment across the four FCA vulnerability
      drivers: health, life events, resilience, and capability.
    required: true
    severity: critical
    guidance: >
      A bare statement that the client is "not vulnerable" is insufficient.
      The note should show that a genuine assessment was made — either through
      a formal vulnerability screening tool or through narrative evidence of
      the adviser's observation and enquiry. Where vulnerability indicators are
      present, document what adjustments were made to the advice process (e.g.
      simplified communications, additional time, third-party support, cooling-off
      period). Consumer Duty applies on an ongoing basis — vulnerability must be
      re-assessed at each interaction, not just at onboarding. Record any changes
      in vulnerability status since the previous meeting.
    examples:
      - "No vulnerability indicators identified at this meeting. Client engaged confidently throughout, demonstrated clear understanding of recommendations, asked pertinent questions about drawdown tax implications, and confirmed no significant changes to health, personal circumstances, or financial resilience since last review. Vulnerability status: unchanged (low risk)."
      - "Vulnerability indicator identified: life event — client disclosed bereavement of spouse (December 2025). Client is now sole decision-maker for household finances for the first time. Adjustments made: (1) meeting extended by 30 minutes; (2) written summary of recommendations issued prior to any action being taken; (3) client advised of right to bring a trusted person to future meetings; (4) 30-day follow-up call scheduled before proceeding with pension consolidation. Client confirmed they wished to continue the meeting."
      - "Client disclosed mild cognitive difficulties (early-stage diagnosis, self-reported). Vulnerability indicator: health. EDD applied: (1) meeting conducted with client's daughter (with client's written consent); (2) all documents issued in large print; (3) no immediate action taken — suitability report issued for consideration over 4 weeks; (4) referral made to firm's vulnerable client support team. Escalated to compliance for review."
    anti_patterns:
      - "Not vulnerable."
      - "No vulnerability concerns noted."
      - "Vulnerability: N/A."

  - id: existing_arrangements
    description: >
      The note must document the client's existing financial arrangements
      relevant to the advice, including: investment portfolios, ISAs, pension
      arrangements (workplace, personal, DB/DC), protection policies, cash
      savings, property assets and liabilities, and any other products that
      may interact with the recommendation. Values and providers should be
      recorded where known.
    required: true
    severity: high
    guidance: >
      Understanding the client's full financial picture is necessary to avoid
      duplicative, contradictory, or harmful recommendations (e.g. recommending
      a new pension when the client has unused DB benefits; recommending an ISA
      subscription when the annual allowance is already used). Where the client
      has not provided full information, document what was provided and what
      remains outstanding. For annual reviews, the note should compare current
      values and allocation against the previous review and explain material
      changes. Pension transfer advice requires specific disclosure of all
      existing pension terms including any guaranteed benefits.
    examples:
      - "Existing arrangements recorded: (1) S&S ISA — Hargreaves Lansdown, current value £67,000, invested in HL Multi-Manager Balanced; (2) Workplace DC pension — Aviva, employer scheme, estimated value £43,000 (last statement Dec 2025), client contributing 5%, employer 4%; (3) Cash savings — £22,000 across two accounts (Lloyds current account £7,000, Marcus easy access £15,000); (4) Residential mortgage — NatWest, £148,000 outstanding, 6 years remaining, fixed rate to 2027; (5) No protection products in force."
      - "Three legacy personal pensions identified: (i) Scottish Widows (employer from 2008–2014, est. value £34,000); (ii) Aviva (self-employed contributions 2014–2018, est. value £28,500); (iii) Standard Life (current employer, est. value £24,000 — still contributing). No guaranteed annuity rates on (i) or (ii) — confirmed in writing. No DB entitlements. ISA allowance: not utilised current tax year."
      - "Portfolio update since last review (Feb 2025): total portfolio value £412,000 (up 8.3% net of withdrawals). Asset allocation drift noted — equity weighting at 72% vs. target 65%; rebalancing recommended. New arrangement since last review: client opened JISA for grandchild — £9,000 subscribed, provider Vanguard."
    anti_patterns:
      - "Existing arrangements discussed."
      - "Client has pensions and savings."
      - "Portfolio reviewed — details on file."

  - id: charges
    description: >
      The note must disclose all charges, costs, and fees associated with the
      recommended product(s), platform, and advice service, in both percentage
      and monetary terms where possible. This includes: ongoing adviser charges,
      one-off advice fees, platform/wrap charges, product/fund ongoing charges
      (OCF/AMC), transaction costs, and any third-party costs. Disclosure must
      comply with COBS 6.1ZA and MiFID II costs and charges requirements.
    required: true
    severity: high
    guidance: >
      A summary reference to a separate costs and charges illustration (CCI) is
      acceptable provided the CCI is cross-referenced, dated, and confirmed as
      issued to and acknowledged by the client. The note should record the total
      cost figure (e.g. total annual cost as % and £ on invested amount) to
      enable the client to understand the aggregate impact. Where charges are
      contingent (e.g. a switch triggers exit charges), these must be itemised.
      Fair value assessment: under Consumer Duty, the note should confirm that
      charges have been assessed as providing fair value given the service and
      outcomes delivered.
    examples:
      - "Charges disclosed: (1) Ongoing adviser charge: 0.75% pa (£562.50 pa on £75,000 portfolio); (2) Platform charge: Transact 0.25% pa (tiered — 0.20% above £250,000); (3) Fund OCF: blended 0.19% pa; (4) Total ongoing charge: 1.19% pa (£892.50 pa). No initial or switch fees. Costs and charges illustration (ref: CCI-END-20260214) issued and acknowledged by client. Fair value confirmed — charges reflect bespoke portfolio management and ongoing review service."
      - "One-off advice fee: £2,500 (pension transfer analysis and recommendation). Ongoing adviser charge: 0.5% pa (charged from SIPP). Platform (AJ Bell): 0.25% pa. Fund OCF: 0.22% pa. Total year one cost: £2,500 + £748.50 ongoing = disclosed in CCI ref AJB-20260214. Exit charge from ceding scheme: nil (confirmed by Aviva). Client confirmed understanding of all charges in writing."
      - "Charges compared to prior arrangement: previous platform (Aviva) total cost 1.65% pa. Recommended platform (Transact) total cost 1.19% pa. Annual saving: approximately £345 on current portfolio value. Net benefit of switch positive after accounting for nil exit charges and re-registration costs."
    anti_patterns:
      - "Charges discussed and agreed."
      - "Fees as per our standard schedule."
      - "Costs explained — see separate document."

  - id: actions
    description: >
      The note must record all actions agreed during the meeting, specifying
      who is responsible for each action, the expected timeline or deadline,
      and any dependencies or prerequisites. This should include both adviser
      actions and client actions, covering implementation steps, documentation
      required, referrals to other specialists, and the date of the next review
      or follow-up contact.
    required: true
    severity: high
    guidance: >
      Vague commitments such as "adviser to follow up" or "next steps TBC" are
      insufficient. Each action should be specific and time-bound. Where client
      actions are required before the adviser can proceed (e.g. provision of
      documents, signatures), record this dependency clearly. Actions arising
      from vulnerability adjustments (e.g. extended cooling-off, follow-up call)
      should be included. The action list serves as an audit trail for
      supervisory oversight and for complaint handling — ensure it is complete.
    examples:
      - "Actions agreed: (1) Adviser: submit ISA subscription application (£20,000, Transact) by 28/02/2026 — client to provide payment authority by 21/02/2026; (2) Adviser: initiate pension consolidation — LOA forms sent to client for signature, return requested by 28/02/2026; (3) Client: provide copy of most recent Aviva pension statement (requested in meeting); (4) Adviser: issue suitability report within 5 working days; (5) Next annual review: February 2027 — calendar invite sent."
      - "Next steps: (1) Adviser to submit drawdown commencement request to Quilter within 3 working days of receipt of signed application (client to sign and return by post — envelope provided); (2) Client to contact HMRC to update tax code on pension income (adviser to provide template letter); (3) Follow-up call scheduled 7 March 2026 to confirm first payment received; (4) Adviser to review expression of wishes nomination — client to complete updated form."
      - "Actions: (1) No immediate investment action — client wishes to take 4 weeks to consider recommendation before proceeding (vulnerability adjustment); (2) Adviser to resend suitability report in larger font (14pt) by 17/02/2026; (3) Follow-up meeting to be scheduled for w/c 16/03/2026 with client's daughter present; (4) Compliance notification filed re: vulnerable client protocol."

      - "Actions to follow."
      - "Will be in touch."
      - "Next steps to be confirmed."

  - id: client_agreement
    description: >
      The note must record that the client received, understood, and
      acknowledged the recommendation, including acknowledgement of the costs
      and charges, the risks involved, and any right to a cooling-off period.
      Where a client declines or defers a recommendation, this should also be
      recorded, together with any information provided about the consequences
      of not proceeding.
    required: true
    severity: high
    guidance: >
      Evidence of client agreement may take the form of a signed letter of
      authority, electronic signature, verbal confirmation recorded in the note,
      or a signature on the suitability report itself. Under Consumer Duty, the
      firm must have reasonable assurance that the client understood the
      recommendation — a signature alone may be insufficient where there are
      comprehension concerns (e.g. vulnerability indicators). Where a client
      proceeds against adviser recommendation, document this as an execution-only
      instruction with the client's reasons recorded.
    examples:
      - "Client confirmed agreement with all recommendations verbally during the meeting and subsequently via signed letter of authority received 14/02/2026. Suitability report to be issued within 5 working days; client advised of right to raise concerns or withdraw instructions within that period. Client confirmed understanding of charges, risks, and the basis of the recommendation."
      - "Electronic signature obtained via DocuSign (envelope ID: DS-20260214-0042) on suitability report and costs disclosure illustration. Client confirmed receipt and confirmed no further questions. Two-day cooling-off period noted; no contact received. Instructions to proceed authorised 16/02/2026."
      - "Client declined drawdown recommendation and elected to take tax-free cash only at this stage, deferring income drawdown decision by 6 months. Execution-only instruction recorded for PCLS payment of £55,000. Client provided written confirmation of decision against advice (form EO-2026-001 retained on file). Risks of delay and ongoing pension charges explained."

  - id: tax
    description: >
      The note must document the tax considerations relevant to the advice,
      including as applicable: pension tax relief (rate applicable to the
      client, annual allowance, lifetime allowance legacy protections),
      Capital Gains Tax (annual exemption, estimated gain, tax band),
      Inheritance Tax (estate position, available reliefs, potential IHT
      liability), and Income Tax implications of investment returns or
      withdrawals. Where tax advice falls outside the scope of the firm's
      permissions, referrals to a tax specialist or accountant should be noted.
    required: true
    severity: high
    guidance: >
      Tax considerations must be personalised to the client's situation. A
      generic statement that "ISAs are tax-efficient" does not satisfy this
      requirement. Where the advice has material tax implications (e.g. a large
      pension withdrawal triggering higher-rate tax, a disposal crystallising a
      significant CGT liability), these must be quantified or estimated. Document
      whether the client has sought or been referred for independent tax advice.
      Pension annual allowance must be confirmed as sufficient for recommended
      contributions, with reference to any carry forward used. Post-April 2024
      LTA abolition should be referenced where relevant.
    examples:
      - "Tax position: client is a higher-rate (40%) taxpayer. Pension contributions of £20,000 recommended — basic rate relief claimed at source (£16,000 net contribution); client must claim additional 20% (£4,000) via self-assessment. Annual allowance: £60,000 — utilised £24,000 via employer scheme; £36,000 available. No LTA protections in place (post-April 2024 LTA abolished). ISA subscription of £20,000 recommended to shelter future growth from CGT and income tax — full annual allowance available."
      - "CGT consideration: client proposing to encash unit trust (estimated gain £48,000, cost basis £20,000). CGT annual exemption: £3,000. Estimated taxable gain: £45,000. At basic rate (10%) this would crystallise approximately £4,500 CGT. Adviser recommended phased disposal over two tax years to utilise two annual exemptions — estimated CGT saving £300. Client's accountant to be consulted re: other disposals in current tax year."
      - "IHT position: client's estate estimated at £1.4m (property £950,000, pension £280,000 excluded post-April 2027 rule change, investments £170,000). Nil-rate band £325,000 + RNRB £175,000 = £500,000 threshold. Estimated IHT exposure: £360,000. IHT planning not in scope of this advice; referral letter to specialist solicitor provided at client's request."

    description: >
      Under MiFID II sustainability preferences requirements (as amended 2022)
      and FCA expectations under SDR, the note must document: whether ESG or
      sustainability preferences were assessed, the outcome of that assessment,
      and how the recommended product(s) address (or do not address) those
      preferences. Where the client has preferences that cannot be fully met
      by available products, the note must document how this was handled and
      whether the client accepted a product that partially meets their
      preferences.
    required: true
    severity: medium
    guidance: >
      ESG preferences must be assessed positively — it is not sufficient to
      note only that the client has no preferences. The assessment should
      cover the three MiFID II preference categories: (1) minimum proportion
      in EU Taxonomy-aligned investments, (2) minimum proportion in sustainable
      investments per SFDR Art.9/2(17), and (3) consideration of principal
      adverse impacts (PAIs). In practice, advisers may use a simplified
      preference questionnaire, but the outcome must be recorded. Where the
      client has preferences, document the SFDR classification of recommended
      funds (Article 6, 8, or 9). Under FCA SDR, use of sustainability labels
      should be referenced where applicable.
    examples:
      - "ESG preferences assessed via firm's sustainability questionnaire (completed in meeting). Client expressed strong preference for exclusion of fossil fuel companies and arms manufacturers. No minimum Taxonomy or SFDR allocation requirement specified by client beyond these exclusions. Recommended funds: Rathbone Greenbank Global Sustainability Fund (Article 8 SFDR, fossil fuel and weapons exclusions confirmed) and Royal London Sustainable Leaders (Article 8). Client confirmed these meet their preferences. SDR label: 'Sustainability Focus' (RLSL)."
      - "ESG questionnaire completed. Client has no specific sustainability preferences and prioritises financial returns above sustainability considerations. Confirmed they do not wish to restrict investment universe on ESG grounds. Conventional fund range recommended (Vanguard LifeStrategy — Article 6 SFDR). Client acknowledged availability of sustainable alternatives and confirmed this choice. Documented per MiFID II requirement to record outcome even where no preferences expressed."
      - "Client expressed preference for impact investing — wishes capital to demonstrably contribute to positive environmental outcomes. Recommended Impax Environmental Markets Investment Trust (Article 9 SFDR equivalent, FCA-authorised). ESG methodology and impact reporting explained. Client noted that financial return is secondary to impact for this portion of the portfolio (£50,000 of £200,000 total). Remainder of portfolio in conventional funds per client's instruction."
    anti_patterns:
      - "ESG discussed."
      - "Client has no ESG preference noted."
      - "Client happy with ESG approach — sustainable funds selected."

meeting_type_overrides:
  annual_review:
    description: >
      Overrides applied when the meeting is an annual suitability review of
      an existing client relationship. The review must confirm continued
      suitability of all existing holdings, reassess the client's circumstances,
      and identify any material changes since the prior review.
    elements:
      client_id:
        required: false
        severity: low
        notes: >
          Existing client — identity verification already on file. Re-verification
          only required if triggered by a periodic CDD review cycle (typically
          every 2–3 years), a change in client risk classification, or a suspicious
          activity indicator. Note the last verification date.
      meeting_context:
        required: true
        severity: high
        notes: >
          Must confirm this is a periodic review, record the date of the previous
          review, and document whether the client's circumstances have changed
          materially since that review.
      objectives:
        required: true
        severity: critical
        notes: >
          Objectives must be actively re-confirmed or updated — do not carry
          forward from the prior review without explicit client confirmation.
          Life stage changes (e.g. approaching retirement, bereavement, redundancy)
          may significantly alter objectives.
      risk_tolerance:
        required: true
        severity: critical
        notes: >
          ATR and CfL must be re-assessed annually. A repeat questionnaire is
          best practice. Document any changes in risk profile and, if the existing
          portfolio is now misaligned, document the rebalancing recommendation or
          record the client's informed decision not to rebalance.
      suitability_rationale:
        required: true
        severity: critical
        notes: >
          Must confirm that existing holdings remain suitable in light of current
          circumstances, not merely that they were suitable at outset. Where no
          changes are recommended, a positive statement of continued suitability
          is required.
      vulnerability:
        required: true
        severity: critical
        notes: >
          Consumer Duty requires ongoing vulnerability assessment at every
          client interaction. Record whether vulnerability status has changed
          since the last review and any adjustments made.
      existing_arrangements:
        required: true
        severity: critical
        notes: >
          Full portfolio review required — record current values, asset allocation,
          performance since last review, and any drift from target allocation.
          Compare to prior review and explain material changes.
      charges:
        required: true
        severity: high
        notes: >
          Annual confirmation that charges continue to represent fair value is
          required under Consumer Duty. Note any charge changes since the prior
          review and confirm the client remains aware of the total cost.
      tax:
        required: true
        severity: high
        notes: >
          Tax position should be reviewed annually given potential changes in
          allowances (CGT exemption, pension annual allowance, ISA limits),
          the client's income and tax band, and any legislative changes.
      esg:
        required: true
        severity: high
        notes: >
          MiFID II requires ESG preferences to be re-assessed at least annually.
          Confirm whether preferences have changed and whether recommended funds
          continue to meet those preferences.
      actions:
        required: true
        severity: high
        notes: >
          Review actions from the prior meeting and confirm completion status
          before recording new actions.
      client_agreement:
        required: true
        severity: high
        notes: >
          Client must confirm continued agreement with existing strategy or
          agreement to any changes recommended at the review.

  ad_hoc_call:
    description: >
      Overrides applied when the interaction is an unscheduled or ad hoc
      contact — typically client-initiated to discuss a specific concern,
      market event, or minor change — where no new formal recommendation
      is necessarily made. Where a recommendation is made in an ad hoc
      call, full suitability requirements apply.
    elements:
      client_id:
        required: false
        severity: low
        notes: >
          Existing client — ID verification not required for an ad hoc call
          unless a new transaction is being initiated that triggers AML
          re-verification requirements.
      meeting_context:
        required: true
        severity: high
        notes: >
          Must document the purpose of the call, who initiated it, and what
          was discussed. If no recommendation was made, this should be stated
          explicitly.
      objectives:
        required: false
        severity: medium
        notes: >
          Full objectives re-assessment is not required for an ad hoc call
          where no recommendation is made. However, if the client's circumstances
          suggest a material change in objectives, escalate to a full review.
      risk_tolerance:
        required: false
        severity: medium
        notes: >
          Risk re-assessment not required for an informational or reassurance
          call. Required if any new recommendation is made during the call.
      suitability_rationale:
        required: false
        severity: high
        notes: >
          Required only if a recommendation is made during the ad hoc call.
          If no recommendation is made, note this explicitly. If a recommendation
          is made, full suitability rationale must be documented.
      vulnerability:
        required: true
        severity: high
        notes: >
          Consumer Duty requires vulnerability to be considered at every client
          interaction regardless of meeting type. Even for a brief call, note
          any indicators observed and any adjustments made.
      existing_arrangements:
        required: false
        severity: low
        notes: >
          Full review of existing arrangements is not required unless the call
          leads to a recommendation to change or add to those arrangements.
      charges:
        required: false
        severity: medium
        notes: >
          Charges disclosure required only if a new product, transaction, or
          change in service level is recommended during the call.
      tax:
        required: false
        severity: low
        notes: >
          Tax considerations required only if a transaction with tax implications
          is recommended or executed during the ad hoc call.
      esg:
        required: false
        severity: low
        notes: >
          ESG re-assessment not required for an ad hoc call unless a new
          investment recommendation is made.
      actions:
        required: true
        severity: high
        notes: >
          Any commitments made during the call — by adviser or client — must be
          recorded, even if they are minor (e.g. "will send updated factsheet").
      client_agreement:
        required: false
        severity: medium
        notes: >
          Required if any instruction or recommendation is confirmed during the
          call. If the call is purely informational, record that no instruction
          was given.

  new_client:
    description: >
      Overrides applied when the meeting is with a new client — i.e. a client
      for whom the firm has no prior suitability record. All elements are
      required in full, and enhanced standards apply to identity verification,
      fact-finding, and disclosure.
    elements:
      client_id:
        required: true
        severity: critical
        notes: >
          Full CDD mandatory for all new clients. Where risk factors are present
          (HNW, complex source of wealth, PEP, non-standard nationality), EDD
          must be applied before any recommendation is made. Do not proceed to
          advice until CDD is complete and satisfactory.
      meeting_context:
        required: true
        severity: high
        notes: >
          Document how the client was introduced (referral, marketing, direct
          enquiry), the scope of the initial engagement, and any disclosure of
          the firm's services and regulatory status made at the outset.
      objectives:
        required: true
        severity: critical
        notes: >
          Full fact-find required. For a new client, objectives should be explored
          in depth — do not rely on client's initial framing. Probe for competing
          priorities, undisclosed constraints, and life stage context.
      risk_tolerance:
        required: true
        severity: critical
        notes: >
          ATR questionnaire must be completed and retained for all new clients.
          CfL must be assessed with reference to the client's full financial
          position established during the fact-find.
      suitability_rationale:
        required: true
        severity: critical
        notes: >
          For a new client, the rationale must also explain why this product
          is suitable relative to the client's existing arrangements (if any),
          and confirm that any recommendation to switch or consolidate is in
          the client's best interest.
      vulnerability:
        required: true
        severity: critical
        notes: >
          Initial vulnerability assessment must be thorough for a new client
          where no prior relationship exists. Use a structured vulnerability
          screening approach and document the outcome in full.
      existing_arrangements:
        required: true
        severity: high
        notes: >
          A complete picture of existing arrangements is essential before making
          any recommendation to a new client. Do not make a recommendation until
          all material existing arrangements have been disclosed and considered.
      charges:
        required: true
        severity: critical
        notes: >
          Initial disclosure of all charges must be given at the outset of the
          new client relationship, prior to any advice being provided.
          The client must have the opportunity to understand and accept the
          cost of the service before proceeding. Record explicit acknowledgement.
      tax:
        required: true
        severity: high
        notes: >
          Full tax fact-find required for new clients — establish income tax
          band, pension annual allowance position, CGT history, IHT exposure,
          and any relevant tax protections or elections in place.
      esg:
        required: true
        severity: high
        notes: >
          ESG preference assessment is mandatory for all new clients at
          onboarding under MiFID II. Use a structured questionnaire and
          retain the output.
      actions:
        required: true
        severity: high
        notes: >
          For a new client, actions should include all outstanding fact-find
          items, document requests, and the timeline for issuing the suitability
          report. Do not commence implementation until the suitability report
          has been issued and the client has had the opportunity to review it.
      client_agreement:
        required: true
        severity: critical
        notes: >
          For a new client, explicit written acknowledgement of the recommendation
          is required before implementation. Ensure the client has received the
          suitability report, the costs and charges illustration, and the client
          agreement/terms of business, and that all have been acknowledged.
